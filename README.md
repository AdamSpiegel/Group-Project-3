## Description 👗🎁🥂👔

Eventful was developed as an event and party planning application, designed to target the busy or stressed out individual who could use help with their organization. Eventful was created to be a helpful tool for anyone who wants to build out their planning with a resource that ensures you will not forget any small detail! As a user, you have the ability to completely create and tailor your individual event or party from scratch, access your in-progress events, modify, and delete them.

## Project Usage 👰‍♀️💌⛪🤵‍♂️

<br>

## _User Story_

As an Event Planner:
I want the ability to create a “Party Planner” account by signing up,
OR the ability to login to view my saved and in progress events.

After signing up,
I want to see my dashboard with any upcoming or in progress events.

I want to click on a button which says, “All My Events” and can view all my planned and published events.

I want to click on a specific event to edit/modify and/or delete event, in addition to options for sending invites and linking to my calendars.
